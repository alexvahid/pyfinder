# Using concrete dictionary rather than the lib.se one

# the 'in' method in python will call __contains__
# which is on a concrete dictionary. Without somehow capturing
# information about the dictionary or wrapping it into
# a specialized class, we can't override __contains__ to
# capture the fact that a symbolic value is passed in.
# related: __r*__ methods (eg __radd__) likely wouldn't
# work here, as I believe dict does not throw a
# NotImplemented exception for any inputs.

# @symbolic(in1=3) # including this allows for passing
# why? jteoh suspects that the __contains__ method will
# try calling == for each key and in1, which passes because
# __eq__ is not implemented for symbolic types and python will
# swap arguments (commutative) to call the symbolic.__eq__ fn
